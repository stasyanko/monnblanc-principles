## Messaging

> “I’m sorry that I long ago coined the term “objects” for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is messaging.”
> ~ Alan Kay

Objects must be like small computers that talk to each other via messaging.
Imagine, that you work in a company's accounting department. You got married recently and you need to change your data in your personal card of a worker. This personal card is stored in an HR (human resources) department. 
How do you do it? You go to a room with a filing cabinet and change your marital status yourself?
Nope. You just notify the HR department on that and only this departmant has "write" access to a filing cabinet with your personal card.
